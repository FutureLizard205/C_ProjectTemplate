# WarpWriggleCLI

WIP - Don't expect much yet!

## Hardware Requirements

- Terminal with UTF-8 support
- x86-64 CPU
- Windows or Linux

(It can also be compiled to other architectures/systems)

## Downloads

### Releases (not yet added)

The Releases section has the stable releases organized with version numbers and changelogs.

The version number will always be displayed in the game's main menu.

### Development Builds

To download development builds, go to the Actions tab and download the intended Artifact.

These are produced for every commit to the main branch.

## Installation

Just extract the file to a folder and you can run the program directly from there. 

You may need to manually open a terminal and run the executable through there.
